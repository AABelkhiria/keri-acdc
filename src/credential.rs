//! ACDC credentials: the container itself, and the two self-addressing identifiers it carries.
//!
//! An Authentic Chained Data Container is a JSON document naming its issuer, the registry whose
//! transaction event log governs its status, the schema it claims to satisfy, and a block of
//! attributes about its subject. Two of its fields are digests of the document that carries them:
//! the attribute block's `d` commits to the attributes, and the credential's own `d` commits to
//! the whole container including that first digest. Nothing else identifies a credential, so
//! deriving those two digests *is* issuing it.
//!
//! This module ports the two `Saider.saidify(...)` expressions inside `Credentials.issue` in the
//! pinned `src/keri/app/credentialing.ts`. The TEL issuance event those expressions feed, the
//! interaction event anchoring it, and the request that submits all three are Roadmap 6.2 and
//! 6.11; nothing here is aware of a registry's event log or of KERIA.
//!
//! # Field order is the credential's identity
//!
//! Both digests are taken over the exact serialization, so field order is not cosmetic. The
//! container's order is fixed — `v`, `d`, `u`, `i`, `ri`, `s`, `a`, `e`, `r`, with absent optional
//! fields simply absent — but the *attribute* block's order is the caller's, because the reference
//! spreads the caller's attributes into it. [`CredentialAttributes`] therefore preserves the order
//! its methods are called in, and [`CredentialAttributes::timestamp`] exists so a caller can place
//! `dt` where the reference's callers place it rather than at the end.
//!
//! # What this port refuses
//!
//! The reference validates none of its inputs. Four of its behaviours are recorded in
//! `fixtures/acdc-credential/` and deliberately not reproduced, because each derives an identifier
//! from something other than what the caller supplied:
//!
//! - **JavaScript hoists array-index-like keys.** An attribute named `0` is serialized ahead of
//!   every other field, including the `d` written first, and the digest commits to that order. An
//!   insertion-ordered map cannot reproduce it — ADR `0008` settled that — so such a label is
//!   rejected in every caller-supplied block rather than silently committing to different bytes.
//! - **An attribute named `v` is treated as a version string** and rewritten to the block's own
//!   length. `v` is reserved here, as is `d`, which the reference overwrites with its placeholder.
//! - **A fractional or oversized number is committed as a double.** `SadValue` accepts only exact
//!   safe integers, for the reason ADR `0008` gives.
//! - **The issuer, registry, schema, and issuee are unchecked text.** Here they are typed.
//!
