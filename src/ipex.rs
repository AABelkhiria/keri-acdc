//! IPEX: the five messages two controllers exchange to disclose a credential.
//!
//! The Issuance and Presentation Exchange protocol is a conversation, and each step is an `exn`
//! message naming the step before it:
//!
//! ```text
//! apply   disclosee asks for a credential satisfying a schema      (no prior)
//!   ↓
//! offer   discloser answers with the credential, embedded          (prior: the apply)
//!   ↓
//! agree   disclosee accepts                                        (prior: the offer)
//!   ↓
//! grant   discloser sends the credential and its provenance        (prior: the agree)
//!   ↓
//! admit   disclosee acknowledges receipt                           (prior: the grant)
//! ```
//!
//! Either side may start: a discloser with a `grant` and no prior, or a disclosee with an `apply`.
//! Only `offer` and `grant` embed anything, and only a `grant` carries attachments — the three
//! that chain a credential to a signed key event, which [`issuance`](crate::issuance) produces.
//!
//! This module ports the pure half of `Ipex.apply`, `.offer`, `.agree`, `.grant`, and `.admit` in
//! the pinned `src/keri/app/credentialing.ts`, together with the `createExchangeMessage`
//! composition of `src/keri/app/exchanging.ts` that each calls. The message itself is Roadmap
//! 3.8's [`ExchangeBuilder`]; what is added here is the route, the payload each route carries, and
//! the embeds. Signing is the sender's: [`SignedIpexMessage`] pairs a message with the signatures
//! produced over it. Submitting the result is Roadmap 6.12.
//!
//! # The message is required on every route
//!
//! Four of the five upstream methods write `m: args.message ?? ''`. `admit` writes
//! `m: args.message`, so an admit built without a message emits an attribute block carrying **no
//! `m` field at all** — a different message with a different identifier from one carrying the
//! empty string. Whether the field exists at all should not depend on which argument a caller
//! happened to omit, so the message is required here and an empty one is spelled explicitly. See
//! `fixtures/acdc-ipex/`.
//!
//! # Example
//!
//! ```
//! use keri_acdc::ipex::{IpexEnvelope, IpexRoute};
//! use keri_protocol::prefix::IdentifierPrefix;
//!
//! # fn main() -> Result<(), Box<dyn std::error::Error>> {
//! let envelope = IpexEnvelope::new(
//!     IdentifierPrefix::from_qb64("ELUvZ8aJEHAQE-0nsevyYTP98rBbGJUrTj5an-pCmwrK")?,
//!     IdentifierPrefix::from_qb64("ELjSFdrTdCebJlmvbFNX9-TLhR2PO0_60al1kQp5_e6k")?,
//!     "Applying",
//!     "2023-08-23T15:16:07.553000+00:00".parse()?,
//! )?;
//!
//! assert_eq!(IpexRoute::Apply.as_str(), "/ipex/apply");
//! assert_eq!(envelope.message(), "Applying");
//! # Ok(())
//! # }
